# How Pattern-Based Extraction Works in NexusRAG

## 🔍 **What is Pattern-Based Extraction?**

Pattern-based extraction is the **fallback method** in NexusRAG's hybrid enhancement system. When LangExtract or AI services are unavailable, the system uses **regular expressions (regex)** to find and extract educational metadata from text content.

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ **No API calls** required - works completely offline
- ✅ **100% reliable** - always works regardless of internet/API issues
- ✅ **Fast processing** - instant regex matching vs. 2-3 seconds for AI
- ✅ **Zero cost** - no cloud service fees
- ✅ **Predictable results** - consistent pattern matching

## 🔍 **Pattern Matching Process**

### **Step-by-Step Extraction**:
```python
def _extract_with_patterns(self, content: str, category: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract content using regex patterns"""
    
    results = []
    patterns = self.patterns.get(category, [])
    
    # 1. Apply each pattern to the content
    for pattern in patterns:
        matches = re.finditer(pattern, content, re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE)
        
        # 2. Process each match
        for match in matches:
            text = match.group(1).strip()
            
            # 3. Quality filter - ignore very short matches

### **Input Content**:
```text
Chapter 4: Photosynthesis and Plant Nutrition

Learning Objectives:
- Students will understand the process of photosynthesis
- Learn about factors affecting plant growth

Key Concepts: Chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, oxygen, glucose

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.
This process occurs in the chloroplasts and requires several inputs.

Prerequisites: Students should understand basic plant anatomy and cell structure.

Study Questions:
1. What are the main inputs for photosynthesis?
2. Where does photosynthesis occur in plant cells?
3. What are the products of photosynthesis?

Example: A green leaf placed in sunlight demonstrates the photosynthesis process.
```

### **Pattern Matching Results**:

#### **1. Learning Objectives Extraction**:
```python
Pattern: r'learning objective[s]?[:\-]\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)'
Matches: "- Students will understand the process of photosynthesis"

Pattern: r'students will\s+(.+?)(?:\n|\.)'
Matches: "understand the process of photosynthesis"

Results: [
    {"text": "Students will understand the process of photosynthesis", "confidence": 0.8},
    {"text": "understand the process of photosynthesis", "confidence": 0.8}
]
```

#### **2. Key Concepts Extraction**:
```python
Pattern: r'key concepts?[:\-]\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)'

## 🧠 **Advanced Pattern Features**

### **1. Implied Concept Extraction**:
```python
def _extract_implied_concepts(self, content: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract concepts by looking for definition patterns"""
    
    concept_indicators = [
        r'\b([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\s+is\s+(?:a|an|the)',  # "Photosynthesis is a"
        r'\b([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\s+refers?\s+to',      # "Chlorophyll refers to"
        r'\bdefin(?:e|ition)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)',  # "Definition Metabolism"
        r'\b([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)\s+means?',            # "Photosynthesis means"
    ]
    
    # Find concepts like "Photosynthesis is the process..."
    # Extract "Photosynthesis" as a key concept
```

**Example**:
```text
Input: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight."
Pattern Match: r'\b([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+is\s+(?:a|an|the)'
Extracted Concept: "Photosynthesis"
```

### **2. Content Section Detection**:
```python
def _extract_content_sections(self, content: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract chapters and section headings"""
    
    # Chapter pattern
    chapter_pattern = r'^(chapter\s+\d+[:\-]?\s*(.+))$'
    
    # Section patterns
    section_patterns = [
        r'^([A-Z][^.!?]*):$',          # "SECTION TITLE:"
        r'^(\d+\.\s+[^.!?]+)$',        # "1. Section Title"
        r'^([A-Z][A-Z\s]{10,})$'       # "ALL CAPS HEADINGS"
    ]
```

**Example**:
```text
Input: "Chapter 4: Photosynthesis and Plant Nutrition"
Pattern Match: r'^(chapter\s+\d+[:\-]?\s*(.+))$'
Extracted: {
    "type": "chapter",
    "title": "Photosynthesis and Plant Nutrition",
    "full_heading": "Chapter 4: Photosynthesis and Plant Nutrition"
}
```

### **3. Difficulty Level Assessment**:
```python
def _determine_difficulty_pattern_based(self, content: str) -> str:
    """Assess difficulty by keyword analysis"""
    
    # Advanced indicators
    advanced_terms = ["complex", "advanced", "detailed", "comprehensive", 
                     "analyze", "evaluate", "synthesize", "critical"]
    
    # Basic indicators  
    basic_terms = ["introduction", "basic", "simple", "fundamental", 
                  "begin", "start", "first", "elementary"]
    
    advanced_count = sum(1 for term in advanced_terms if term in content.lower())
    basic_count = sum(1 for term in basic_terms if term in content.lower())
    
    if advanced_count > basic_count and advanced_count >= 2:
        return "advanced"
    elif basic_count > advanced_count and basic_count >= 2:
        return "basic"
    else:
        return "intermediate"
```
