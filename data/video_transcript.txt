Hello everyone, and welcome back to our channel. Today, we're going to take a deep dive into the world of Large Language Models, or LLMs.

First, let's start with the basics. What is an LLM? At its core, an LLM is a type of artificial intelligence that has been trained on a massive amount of text data. This training allows it to understand and generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics.

You've probably already interacted with an LLM without even realizing it. They power many of the chatbots, search engines, and content creation tools we use every day.

Now, let's talk about how they work. LLMs are built on a type of neural network architecture called a Transformer. This architecture is particularly good at handling sequential data, like text. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, which is key to understanding context.

One of the most exciting applications of LLMs is in the field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. RAG combines the generative power of an LLM with an external knowledge base. This allows the model to answer questions and generate text that is not only fluent but also grounded in factual, up-to-date information.

That's all for today's video. I hope this has given you a better understanding of what LLMs are and how they work. If you have any questions, please leave them in the comments below. And don't forget to like and subscribe for more content like this. Thanks for watching!
