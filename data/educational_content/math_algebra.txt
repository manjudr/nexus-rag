ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS

Chapter 1: Introduction to Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.

Chapter 2: Algebraic Expressions

An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain:
- Numbers (constants)
- Variables (letters like x, y, z)
- Operations (+, -, ×, ÷)

Examples:
- 3x + 5
- 2y - 7
- x² + 4x + 3

Chapter 3: Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1.

Standard form: ax + b = 0

Examples:
- 2x + 3 = 7
- 5y - 2 = 13
- 3z + 1 = 10

Solving steps:
1. Isolate the variable term
2. Divide by the coefficient
3. Check your answer

Chapter 4: Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation has the form: ax² + bx + c = 0

Methods to solve:
1. Factoring
2. Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac))/2a
3. Completing the square

Chapter 5: Factorization

Factorization is breaking down an expression into simpler parts (factors).

Common methods:
- Taking out common factors
- Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b)
- Trinomial factoring

Chapter 6: Applications

Algebra is used in:
- Solving real-world problems
- Science calculations
- Engineering
- Economics and finance
