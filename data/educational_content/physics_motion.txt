LAWS OF MOTION AND FORCES

Chapter 1: Introduction to Motion

Motion is change in position with respect to time. Understanding motion helps us describe and predict how objects move.

Chapter 2: Newton's First Law

An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This is also called the law of inertia.

Chapter 3: Newton's Second Law

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

Mathematical form: F = ma
Where F = Force, m = mass, a = acceleration

Chapter 4: Newton's Third Law

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.

Chapter 5: Types of Forces

1. Contact Forces:
   - Normal force
   - Friction force
   - Applied force

2. Non-contact Forces:
   - Gravitational force
   - Electromagnetic force
   - Nuclear force

Chapter 6: Momentum and Impulse

Momentum (p) = mass Ã— velocity
Impulse = change in momentum
Conservation of momentum: Total momentum before collision = Total momentum after collision
