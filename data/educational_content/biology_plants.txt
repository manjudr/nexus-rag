PLANT BIOLOGY AND GROWTH

Chapter 1: Introduction to Plant Life

Plants are living organisms that play a crucial role in our ecosystem. They convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis and provide oxygen for all life on Earth.

Chapter 2: How Plants Grow

Plant growth occurs through cell division and elongation. The primary factors affecting plant growth include:

1. Light - Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis
2. Water - Essential for transport of nutrients
3. Nutrients - Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are key
4. Temperature - Affects enzyme activity and growth rate

Chapter 3: Plant Structure

Plants have several key parts:
- Roots: Absorb water and nutrients from soil
- Stem: Supports the plant and transports materials
- Leaves: Site of photosynthesis
- Flowers: Reproductive organs

Chapter 4: Photosynthesis Process

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using:
- Carbon dioxide from air
- Water from roots
- Sunlight energy
- Chlorophyll in leaves

The chemical equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2

Chapter 5: Plant Reproduction

Plants reproduce through:
- Sexual reproduction (seeds)
- Asexual reproduction (vegetative propagation)

Seeds contain embryos that grow into new plants when conditions are right.

Chapter 6: Plant Nutrition

Plants need both macronutrients and micronutrients:
- Macronutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Micronutrients: Iron, Magnesium, Calcium

Deficiency of these nutrients affects plant growth and health.
